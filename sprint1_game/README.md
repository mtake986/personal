# Overview

This is a shooting game written in Python with PyGame Module. 
Please clone the code into your pc and hit the run button on the IDE to start playing. I recommend playing with multiple people. 
Each player has 10 life and the game restarts 5 seconds after it ends. 
You'll see the two spaceships and below is the movements.
**Yellow**
* 1 => move left
* 2 => move up
* 3 => move down
* 4 => move right
* 5 => shoot a bullet
**Red**
* 6 => shoot a bullet
* 7 => move left
* 8 => move up
* 9 => move down
* 0 => move right

# Development Environment
* python3.8.5
* pygame2.1.2

# Useful Websites
* [YouTube Pygame Crash Course](https://youtu.be/jO6qQDNa2UY)
* [Pygame Documents](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

# Future Work
* Now, each spaceship can shoot only vertically, so increase the number of directions of bullets that reflect when it touches the top and bottom.
