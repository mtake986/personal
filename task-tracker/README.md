# Overview

This is a task tracker app written in JavaScript (React).
This app has simple CRUD features, so users can create a task, read, update, and delete it.
For saving data, I used JSON server although it hasn't worked.

The purpose to create this app is to start a new JavaScript journey. I see JS has a huge potential because it can work for frontend and backend. Also, so many tools for it have been invented such as Next.js, TypeScript so on. I will focus on learning React in a couple of months. After that, I probably move on to MERN stack.
