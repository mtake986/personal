# Overview

This is a blog app written in JavaScript (Node.js and Express.js).
This app has simple CRUD features, so users can create, read, update, and delete an article.
For saving data, I used MongoDB to try MERN stack.

The purpose to create this app is to expand a JavaScript journey I started one month ago.
I see JS has a huge potential because it can work for frontend and backend. Also, so many tools for it have been invented such as Next.js, TypeScript and so on. 
Because I learned React.js two to three weeks ago, I wanted to get in touch with MERN stack. I implemented CRUD features in this app and that was great enough to learn about Node.js and Express.js. I learned Django in the summer of 2021, and I was surprised as I have created this app because the code looks very similar to Django code. 

I will definitely dive into MERN stack and be proficient of it in one month by creating some apps on my own. It will be done step by step so spend some time each day learning MERN stack and creating apps in MERN. First, I will focus on React.
