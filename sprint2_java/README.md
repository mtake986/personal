# Overview

This is a converter app in Java that runs from the terminal. 
If you would like to have fun with this, please clone the code into your pc and hit the run button on the IDE to start.
Users are only asked to type numbers (usually 1~3). The process of showing converted values are: 
1. Continue or quit | 1 => continue, 2 => quit
2. Choose a category | 1 => weight, 2 => temperature, 3 => length
3. Choose a measurement | depends on the category you chose
4. Enter a value you want to convert | 0 <= weight, length <= -99,999.9, -999.9 <= temperature <= 999.9
5. See the results and select continue or quit
