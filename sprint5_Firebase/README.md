# Overview

This is a color palette app written with Firebase and React.js.
This app has simple CRUD features, so users can create, read, update, and delete a palette.
Cloud Firestore is a database to store color palettes. 

The purpose to create this app is to learn Firebase as a complete newbie. I've honestly tried to learn Firebase but I have got bunch of errors and didn't like Firebase. 
As usual, I got errors again in the first new days in this two weeks long sprint. That was because I was using Firebase 9, but Firebase 7 or 8 was used in videos I watched on YouTube.
So, I typed in **firebase 9** in a search bar on YouTube and found really good videos. I put a link of the videos below, so if you want to take a small step into Firebase 9, better to check them out.
